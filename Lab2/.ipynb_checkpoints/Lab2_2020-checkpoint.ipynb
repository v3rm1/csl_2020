    "The Mirman simulation consists of two phases. First, in the *exposure phase*, the model is presented with 1000-syllable sequences. Our recurrent network takes as an input the first syllable (encoded as a one-hot vector representation) and predicts the next syllable (again encoded as a one-hot vector). The second syllable of the word is then the second input and the third syllable is predicted, etc. Does this model look similar to you as the one that Elman used for lexical class learning? In what ways? The purpose of this phase is to simulate the exposure of human subjects to statistical dependencies between syllables of words in an artificial language.\n",

The purpose is for our model to activate one out of 5 unique \"object\" labels after presented with a two-syllable word.

Four different label categories, including different overlapping syllable dependencies with the exposure phase are included in order to further research the connection between this statistical learning and word learning. In other words, the research question at hand is whether an SRN that is trained to predict labels for words consisting of syllable transitions never encountered before (or encountered with smaller probabilities) follows the same behaviour in learning them as human subjects do.\n",
